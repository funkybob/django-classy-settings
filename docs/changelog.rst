Change Log
==========

3.0.5 (2024-01-??)
------------------

Features Added:

- All accesses to SHOUTY_SNAKE_CASE methods on a `BaseSettings` class will now
  be treated as properties.
  Previously accessing these from within a method would require remembering to
  call it.

3.0.4 (2023-11-16)
------------------

Features Added:

- Guarantee a `Settings` class is only instantiated once per call to `use()`
  Note: `getattr_factory` and `dir_factory` are no longer classmethods.
- Break out `get_settings_instance` method from `use` for more flexibility.
- Add more helpful error message when a sub-class can't be found.

Cleanup:

- Moved `BaseSettings` out of `__init__` into its own file.

3.0.3 (2023-06-28)
------------------

Features Added:

- Raise exception when `env()` is called without any arguments at all.

3.0.2 (2023-04-20)
------------------

Housekeeping:

- Added Django 4.2 to CI
- Added Python 3.11 to CI
- Dropped Django 2.2 from CI
- Documentation corrections and clarifications

Features Added:

- `__dir__` now calculates visible attributes every call, instead of when it's constructed.
- `env` instances are now callable, making them somewhat usable outside of classes

3.0.1 (2022-09-15)
------------------

.. warning:: The previous release does not work with Django.

   This release is to fix that glaring mistake.

Bugs Fixed:

- Changed to using lookup syntax to creat prefixed env classes
- Added __dir__ as second return value from `use()` to satisfy Django settings

3.0.0 (2022-09-08)
------------------


.. admonition:: Backwards incompatible changes!

   This release makes major API changes and drops support for some features.

Major overhaul of the code base.

- Supports Python 3.7+
- Removed `toggle` feature entirely.

Features Added:

- Pre-canned typed `env` helpers: `env.bool`, `env.int`, `env.dburl`,
  `env.list`, `env.tuple`
- `BaseSettings` class, with `getattr_factory` and auto-subclass resolution.

2.1.1 (2017-09-22)
------------------

- Renamed @env(type) to cast

Bugs Fixed:

- Fix required env vars not having a name to look up (Thanks pgcd!)

2.1.0 (2017-08-10)
------------------

Removed:

- Dropped Python2 support.
- Removed deprecated ``cbs.BaseSettings``

2.0.1 (2016-04-16)
------------------

Features Added:

- You can now have an env var that _must_ have an env set.

  [Thanks MarkusH]

2.0.0 (2016-02-08)
------------------

The 'softer-touch' branch.

As of 2.0, `django-classy-settings` is advocating a "minimal impact" approach.

As such, it's recommended you retain the default ``settings.py`` as provided by
Django, and only move to a class those settings which change based on
environment.

Deprecation:

- Remove ``cbs.base``
- No longer import ``BaseSettings`` in ``cbs``
- Purged ``cbs.base``
- Moved ``cbs.base.GlobalSettings`` into ``cbs``

1.1.8 (2015-12-??)
------------------

Features Added:

- Use `inspect.ismethod` instead of just `callable` for detecting methods on
  settings classes.

Deprecation:

- Removed ill concieved `@cbs.returns_callable`.  Document a solution instead.

1.1.7 (2015-12-02)
------------------

Features Added:

- Added `@cbs.returns_callable` for settings that return callables

1.1.6 (2015-11-29)
------------------

Features Added:

- Tox config was overhauled, and hooked into "setup.py test" (Thanks TC)

Bugs Fixed:

- Fix case where @env(...) would return a partial on env, instead of the
  sub-class, which broke envbool (Thanks TC)

1.1.5 (2015-11-05)
------------------

Features Added:

- Added Django 1.9 base settings

1.1.4 (2015-09-25)

- Correct call to setdefault in envbool

1.1.3 (2015-08-19)
------------------

Bugs Fixed:

  valid in Django 1.8.

------------------

Bugs Fixed:

- Type-cast values before caching

1.1.1 (2015-07-04)
